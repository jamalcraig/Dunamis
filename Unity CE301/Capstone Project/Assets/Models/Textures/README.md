# Textures
This folder contains textures that I have been used to create materials for the model of game objects in the game. In order to apply the same texture to objects with different UV sizes, I have created multiple materials with different tiling sizes for many of the textures.   

## Dunamis Gem Texture
I created the texture myself using Blender and Photoshop. I used the texture to create a material, which I applied to the Dunamis Gem model.

This texture was used to create materials that were applied to power cores, generators, barrels. There are 4 materials, with different filter colours applied to them. The power cores, as well as the generators, use a red filtered material and a black filtered material. The barrels use the black filtered material.
